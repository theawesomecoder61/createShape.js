createShape.js
==================

Welcome to createShape.js!

## What does it do?
It can create:
- rectangles
- circles
- semicircles
- text

for you without any knowledge of the HTML5 canvas. It can also create canvases for you, if you're that lazy, like I am. :)

## jQuery?
Nope. No dependencies, no worries. All [vanilla](http://www.gianninewyork.com/assets/images/product-Vanilla.jpg) Javascript.

## Size
This plugin ain't fat, so your page load will be a whole lot less.

## So, where's the docs?
There is no docs! However, there is a [wiki](https://github.com/theawesomecoder61/createShape.js/wiki) that you can check out. (It has more than just the docs.)
