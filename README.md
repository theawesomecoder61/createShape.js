createShape.js
==================

Welcome to createShape.js! Check out the [official createShape.js website](http://theawesomecoder61.github.io/createShape.js/)!

## Version 3.7!
- detects for canvas support
- rotate

## What does it do?
It can create:
- canvases
- lines
- rectangles
- circles
- semicircles
- and more!

for you without any knowledge of the HTML5 canvas. :)

## jQuery?
Nope, no dependencies, no worries. All [vanilla](http://www.gianninewyork.com/assets/images/product-Vanilla.jpg) Javascript. See what I did there?

## Size
This plugin isn't huge, so your page load will be a whole lot less.

## So, where's the docs?
There is no docs! However, there is a [wiki](https://github.com/theawesomecoder61/createShape.js/wiki) that you can check out. (It has more than just the docs.)
